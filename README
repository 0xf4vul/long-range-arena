## Long-Range Arena (LRA: pronounced ELRA).

Long-range arena is an effort toward systematic evaluation of efficient
transformer models. The project aims at establishing benchmark tasks/dtasets
using which we can evaluate transformer-based models in a systematic way,
by assessing their generalization power, computational efficiency, memory
foot-print, etc.
Long-range arena also implements different variants of Transformer models in
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), using
[Flax](https://github.com/google/flax).


### Models
* Transformer (standard)
* Reformer
* Synthesizer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00743)

### Datasets / Benchmarks
* LM1B
* WMT
